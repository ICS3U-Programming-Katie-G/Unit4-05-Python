# This program gets the number of terms the user
# would like to add up, then uses a while... loop to get the
# user number, check if it is valid input, then
# adds the number to the sum until the program has added
# the number of terms the user wanted. The sum,
# placed inside a working string, will be
# displayed back to the user along with all the numbers
# the user inputted to be added, so that the user
# can see all of the numbers they entered to be added along
# with the final output. If invalid information is entered
# during the loop for the user number, the program uses a
# continue statement to skip this iteration of the loop.


# this function will get the number of terms from
# the user, then uses a while... loop to add them up
# until the number of terms has been reached,
# then the function displays the sum back to the user,
# complete with error checking.
